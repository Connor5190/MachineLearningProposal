        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <p>Louppe provides a theoretical and practical analysis of Random Forests, explaining how ensemble learning reduces variance and how impurity-based feature importance is computed [1]. This foundation supports the use of Random Forest in our MMA fight prediction model and guides how we interpret which pre-fight fighter attributes most influence predicted outcomes.</p>
        <p>Strobl et al. demonstrate that standard Random Forest importance measures can be biased toward certain predictor types, particularly when variables differ in scale or category count [2]. This is important for our project because MMA data includes mixed feature types (e.g., age, reach, win streak), meaning importance results must be interpreted carefully.</p>
        <p>He and Choi apply ensemble machine learning methods to sports outcome prediction and show that ensemble approaches can achieve strong predictive performance while maintaining interpretability through explanation techniques [3]. Their work reinforces the suitability of ensemble models like Random Forest for structured sports prediction tasks such as forecasting MMA fight outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
        <p class="dataset-intro">The UFC Dataset is a comprehensive mixed martial arts dataset containing every recorded UFC fight along with detailed fighter statistics.</p>
        <p class="dataset-link"><strong>Dataset:</strong> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024?select=ufc_fighters.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaggle — UFC Dataset 2024</a></p>
        <p>The dataset includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete fight history for all UFC events</li>
          <li>Fight-level statistics for both competitors in each bout</li>
          <li>Fighter performance metrics at the time of each fight (e.g., strikes landed, takedowns, submissions, control time, etc.)</li>
          <li>Event metadata such as event name and date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to historical fight data, the dataset also contains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A current roster of UFC fighters</li>
          <li>Updated fighter profiles with their latest physical attributes and career records</li>
          <li>Aggregated career statistics reflecting their most recent information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This structure allows users to analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How fighter performance evolves over time</li>
          <li>How pre-fight statistics relate to fight outcomes</li>
          <li>Predictive modeling using stats available at the time of the fight</li>
          <li>Current fighter comparisons based on up-to-date profile data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because it includes both historical fight-level data (time-specific stats) and a current snapshot of fighter profiles, the dataset supports longitudinal analysis as well as modern fighter evaluation and modeling.</p>

      <section class="problem-section">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Mixed martial arts outcomes are influenced by a combination of fighter attributes, historical performance metrics, and matchup dynamics. Given a dataset containing every UFC fight along with each fighter's statistics at the time of their bout, the objective is to develop a predictive model that determines the probability of a fighter winning a future matchup.</p>
        <p>Specifically, this project aims to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilize historical fight data and pre-fight fighter statistics</li>
          <li>Engineer features that reflect performance trends and stylistic advantages</li>
          <li>Train and evaluate a supervised machine learning model</li>
          <li>Predict the likely winner of an upcoming UFC fight based solely on information available before the fight occurs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The core challenge is to accurately model fight outcomes using only pre-fight data, ensuring the system reflects realistic, real-world prediction constraints.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="motivation-section">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>We're a group of big sports fans and we regularly watch UFC events together. Half the fun for us is debating matchups before the fights start: who has the better striking, whose wrestling will hold up, whether reach or experience will make the difference, etc. We're always making predictions and arguing our cases like analysts.</p>
        <p>This project is exciting for us because it takes something we already love doing and adds a data-driven layer to it. Instead of just going off gut feeling or fighter reputation, we want to see if the numbers actually back up our predictions. Can striking accuracy really predict outcomes? Does reach matter as much as we think? Do certain styles consistently win?</p>
        <p>By building a model using real UFC fight data, we're essentially putting our fight-night debates to the test. It's a way to combine our interest in sports with machine learning and see if we can build something that's both analytical and fun.</p>

      <section class="preprocessing-section">
        <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>To prepare our dataset, we will implement three primary data processing methods. First, we will address missing values using the <code>SimpleImputer</code> class from scikit-learn. Features with excessive missing data will be dropped entirely, while missing essential physical metrics, such as reach, will be imputed using weight-class medians to preserve the integrity of our samples.</p>
        <p>Second, we will perform structural feature engineering using <code>pandas.DataFrame</code> operations. Instead of using isolated individual statistics, we will transform the data into pairwise matchups by calculating relative differentials for each bout, such as differences in striking volume, takedown defense, and reach.</p>
        <p>Third, to mitigate positional bias (i.e., learning a bias towards Fighter A) we will apply data symmetrization. We will duplicate every historical bout, swap the fighters' positions, multiply the differential features by negative one, and invert the target variable. Following this, we will apply feature scaling using scikit-learn’s <code>StandardScaler</code> to normalize variables with vastly different ranges, which is critical for consistent model training.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="ml-section">
        <h2>Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Because our goal is to predict a binary outcome, we will utilize three supervised classification algorithms. First, we will establish an interpretable baseline using <code>LogisticRegression</code> from scikit-learn. This linear model will effectively demonstrate the fundamental relationship between our engineered metric advantages and the probability of winning a bout.</p>
        <p>Second, we will implement a <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> from scikit-learn. This ensemble bagging method constructs a multitude of independent decision trees. By averaging these uncorrelated trees, the Random Forest captures non-linear interactions between fighters' metrics while resisting the high variance common in sports datasets.</p>
        <p>Third, our primary predictive model will be the <code>XGBClassifier</code> from the XGBoost library. This gradient boosting framework builds trees sequentially to correct residual errors from previous iterations. XGBoost includes built-in L1 and L2 regularization, making it highly effective at handling complex, stylistic matchups without overfitting our expanded dataset.</p>
        <p>These selected models directly apply the course's concepts of supervised learning for predictive data analysis. Specifically, we will utilize linear classification for our baseline and advance to tree-based models for our primary predictions.</p>

      <section class="results-and-discussion">
        <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our primary objective is to develop a predictive model that performs comparably to standard betting market favorites through a framework that prioritizes computational sustainability and transparency. To achieve this, we will utilize tree-based models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. These architectures require significantly less GPU-time and electrical power than deep neural networks, ensuring the project remains environmentally efficient while offering superior interpretability.</p>
        <p>We expect that our model will achieve a classification accuracy in the 60% range, representing a statistically significant improvement over a random guess baseline. While this is slightly below the historical 65%-68% win rate of Vegas favorites, it's a competitive benchmark for our model relying exclusively on publicly available fighter metrics and historical match statistics.</p>
        <h3>Quantitative Metrics</h3>
        <p>To evaluate the performance of our UFC fight prediction model, we must utilize specific quantitative metrics looking at various prediction targets including binary outcomes, probabilistic odds, and specific fight endings.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Binary Winner/Loser:</strong> For straightforward win/loss predictions, we will evaluate the model using Accuracy (Total Correct Predictions / Total Predictions). While simple, this provides an effective baseline benchmark to ensure the model is functioning correctly.</li>
          <li><strong>Winning Probability Projections:</strong> When shifting to predict the exact probability of a fighter winning, we will use Brier Score and Log Loss to evaluate model calibration. These metrics compare our forecasted probabilities directly to the ground truth (1 for a win, 0 for a loss). The Brier Score measures the mean squared difference from the true outcome, while Log Loss heavily penalizes overconfident, incorrect predictions. We can then benchmark our model's scores against the implied probabilities of Vegas closing odds to determine our market edge.</li>
          <li><strong>Method and Timing of Victory:</strong> We can further evaluate the model based on the exact nature of the fight's conclusion. If a fight ends in a finish (knockout or submission), we can apply Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to the predicted fight duration to measure how accurately the model forecasted the timing and dominance of the fight. Conversely, if the fight ends in a decision, we will use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the variance between our projected judge's scorecards and the true scorecards.</li>
        </ul>
